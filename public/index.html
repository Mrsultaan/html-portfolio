<h3>Tears of Sun</h3>
<p>A really nice movie, A us marines operation in somewhere in<br />
Africa but a nice one, the theme is they were just trying to get refugees to <br />
their safw houses to protect them from rebels.<br />
</p>

<h3>American Sniper</h3>
<p>This movie is about a us army operation in somewhere in <br />
Afghanistan or iraq its about snipers.<br />
</p>
